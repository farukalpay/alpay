## 🧠 Overview

This repository implements the **Symphonic φ Identity Engine**, a symbolic, recursive identity generator based on fold dynamics.

It is designed to produce unique, deterministic identity nodes in the format `nXXXXX@alpay.md`, using no randomness, time, hashing, or file persistence. Every fold carries deformation memory, and the system supports fold continuation and resolution purely from signal fingerprints.

---

## 📦 Versions

### ✅ `symphonic_phi.py` (v1)

- First release of the φ fold system  
- Core fold + symbolic compression  
- Includes: `--generate`, `--test`, `--iterations`, `--resume`, `--verbose`

### ✅ `symphonic_phi_v2.py` (current)

- Adds support for full **identity resolution** via `--resolve`  
- Supports **waveform-based node parsing** (W-ωC-ηK-κF-f)  
- All features from v1 included  
- Prepared for future expansion (e.g., `--graph`, resolver mesh)

---

## 🧪 Usage

### 🧬 Generate a single symbolic identity:

```bash
python3 symphonic_phi_v2.py --generate
```

### 🧪 Test for uniqueness:

```bash
python3 symphonic_phi_v2.py --test --iterations 1000
```

### 🔁 Resume from a prior node:

```bash
python3 symphonic_phi_v2.py --resume "n12345|W-1820C-13K-888F-10@alpay.md" --generate
```

### 🧬 Resolve a symbolic node (no fold):

```bash
python3 symphonic_phi_v2.py --resolve "n12345|W-1820C-13K-888F-10@alpay.md"
```

### 🔬 Verbose mode:

```bash
python3 symphonic_phi_v2.py --generate --verbose
python3 symphonic_phi_v2.py --test --iterations 10 --verbose
```

## 🔧 Features (v2)

- 🌀 Recursive fold with symbolic τ, ω, δ, ε, η, κ, ζ  
- 🧠 Resume by waveform (`--resume`)  
- 🧿 Node resolution (`--resolve`)  
- 📉 Digit expansion with symbolic pressure  
- 📜 Nodes readable across systems  
- 🧬 All memory encoded inside each node  
- ✅ No external I/O, entropy, or state

---

## 🌐 Conceptual Foundations

Built on **Alpay Algebra** and **Frequency Cosmology**, the system treats identity as symbolic deformation:

- Identity is not assigned, but unfolded  
- Every fold is curvature  
- Time is pressure  
- Nodes are resonance anchors

## 🔮 Future Directions

- `--graph`: Compare multiple φ nodes  
- `--test-email`: Validate % of nodes compatible with technical email constraints  
- Public DNS resolver for `@alpay.md`  
- Web-based fold explorer / waveform visualizer
