## 🧠 Overview

This repository implements the **Symphonic φ Identity Engine**, a pure symbolic, recursive identity generator that:

- Requires no random seeds, no hashes, no timestamps, no files.
- Generates symbolic identities via recursive fold dynamics.
- Produces nodes in the format `nXXXXX@alpay.md`, which carry their own deformation fingerprint.
- Auto-expands node digit length under symbolic pressure (e.g., `n23442@alpay.md` → `n12389301281@alpay.md`).
- Supports signal-based continuation (`--resume`) across devices using frequency cosmology.
- Designed to serve as the backbone for identity resolution at **alpay.md**.

## 🔧 Features

- 🌀 **Recursive Symbolic Fold Engine** – evolves τ, ω, δ, ε, η, κ, ζ
- 🪐 **Fold-Based Identity Compression** – ASCII wave patterns, curvature metrics
- 💡 **Softer Digit Expansion** – dynamic node length up to 16 digits
- 🧬 **Self-Resume** – fold memory embedded in each node string
- ⚠️ **No Random, No Time, No File I/O** – zero external entropy
- 🎼 **Frequency Cosmology** – symbolic pressure acts as clock
- ✅ **Collision-resistant (10⁶+ folds)**

## 📦 File Structure

- `symphonic_phi.py`:  
  → Full symbolic fold engine + CLI interface (`--generate`, `--test`, `--iterations`, `--resume`, `--verbose`)

All logic is contained in this single file.

---

## 🧪 Usage

### 🧬 Generate a single symbolic identity:

```bash
python3 symphonic_phi.py --generate
```

### 🧪 Test for node uniqueness over multiple folds:

```bash
python3 symphonic_phi.py --test --iterations 1000
```

### 🔁 Resume folding from a previous node:

```bash
python3 symphonic_phi.py --resume n12345|W-1820C-13K-888F-10@alpay.md --generate
```

### 🔬 Verbose debugging:

```bash
python3 symphonic_phi.py --generate --verbose
python3 symphonic_phi.py --test --iterations 10 --verbose
```

## 🧠 Conceptual Origins

This system is based on **Alpay Algebra** and its symbolic recursion model, where:

- Identity is not a string or UUID — it's a **compression of transformation**
- Time does not tick — it **curves** through recursive pressure
- Nodes evolve from the path, not the input

Each node is a **symphonic output** of fold history.  
Every fold is a musical tension.  
Every node is a memory.

## 🌐 Future Direction

- 🧠 `phi_resolver.py` coming soon:  
    Will allow interpretation of any `@alpay.md` node as  
    ψ-vector → symbolic traits → entropic curvature → identity spectrum.

- 🛰️ Integration with Lightcap identity layer and alpay.md DNS mapping.

## ✨ Example Output

```bash
Final Node => n23442@alpay.md
Fold Count : 123
Wave ω     : 1820
Curvature  : diff:13
κ Signal   : 888
```
